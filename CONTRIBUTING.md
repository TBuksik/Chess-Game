## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork to your local machine
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-game.git
cd chess-game
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve with a local server:
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Code Style

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features when possible
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing code structure

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculate valid moves for a chess piece
 * @param {ChessPiece} piece - The piece to calculate moves for
 * @param {Array} board - Current board state
 * @returns {Array} Array of valid move coordinates
 */
function calculateValidMoves(piece, board) {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Use meaningful class names
- Group related styles together
- Add comments for complex styles

Example:
```css
/* Chess board squares */
.square {
    position: relative;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

.square--selected {
    background-color: var(--accent-primary);
}
```

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper alt text for images
- Use meaningful id and class names
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Making Changes

### Feature Development

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes in small, logical commits
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Update documentation if necessary

### Bug Fixes

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

2. Fix the bug
3. Add tests if applicable
4. Verify the fix works correctly

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Include more details in the body if necessary

Good examples:
```
Add castling move validation
Fix piece selection on mobile devices
Update README with installation instructions
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your branch to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Create a pull request against the `main` branch

3. Fill out the pull request template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
